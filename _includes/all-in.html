    <h3>Time matters</h3>
    <p>Build <em>Realtime Apps</em> now! Jet is a framework for building distributed realtime
      Apps. It employs fast <em>push technologies</em>
       and differential updates to keep all clients in <em>sync</em>.
       It is very easy to use and features powerful query filters, sorting rules and
	   a Web Inspector, called Radar.
    </p>
    <p>Jet has been designed for <em>IoT</em>
      , <em>Games</em>, <em>Collaborative Apps</em> or anything else where things are in flux and fast
      communication is required.
    Its efficient design allows Jet Daemons to run very nicely on systems with
	rather limited ressources like the <em>RaspberryPi</em>. Jet Peers can even run on <em>Arduino</em>!
